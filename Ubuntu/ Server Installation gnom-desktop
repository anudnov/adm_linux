Install RDP 



1. Remove previously installed xrdp:
$ sudo systemctl disable xrdp
$ sudo systemctl stop xrdp

$ sudo apt purge xrdp
$ sudo apt purge xserver-xorg-core
$ sudo apt purge xserver-xorg-input-all
$ sudo apt purge xorgxrdp
2. Re-install xrdp & required packages:
$ sudo apt install xrdp
$ sudo apt install xserver-xorg-core
$ sudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-all
$ sudo apt install xorgxrdp
You also need to grant access to the /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key file for xrdp user. It is available to members of the ssl-cert group by default.

$ sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert           # add xrdp into ssl-cert group
$ sudo systemctl start xrdp            # start xrdp service
$ systemctl is-active xrdp             # check xrdp state
...
active
$ sudo systemctl enable xrdp           # start xrdp on system start
3. Reboot system:
$ sudo reboot
4. Firewall configuration:
You need to open access on port 3389.

$ sudo ufw allow 3389
It is more secure to open it only for your IP address or network. For example:

$ sudo ufw allow from 10.5.5.0/24 to any port 3389
The best practice is to use an SSH tunnel to connect to the remote desktop and make xRDP listen only for local connections.

5. Setup your RDP-client
Please note that in some cases the user who will connect to xRDP must log out before doing so!

Connect to your server using any RDP client.
Enter the user credentials of your Ubuntu computer.
Now you can see the remote desktop initial screen.

$ sudo systemctl stop xrdp             # stop xrdp service
$ sudo systemctl restart xrdp          # restart xrdp service

$ sudo systemctl enable xrdp           # enable xrdp on system start
$ sudo systemctl disable xrdp          # disable xrdp on system start
