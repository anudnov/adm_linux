For example, in the initial utilities project, the relatively simple wcat program that you create can be tested by running the test-wcat.sh script. This could be accomplished by the following commands:

prompt> git clone https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects
prompt> cd ostep-projects/initial-utilities/wcat
prompt> emacs -nw wcat.c 
prompt> gcc -o wcat wcat.c -Wall 
prompt> ./test-wcat.sh
test 1: passed
test 2: passed
test 3: passed
test 4: passed
test 5: passed
test 6: passed
test 7: passed
prompt> 
Of course, this sequence assumes (a) you use emacs (you should!), (b) your code is written in one shot (impressive!),
